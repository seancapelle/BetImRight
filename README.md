“Bet I’m Right” is an online version of social betting. Users propose a bet based on any topic (sports, film, television, etc.), and other users accept the bet by offering their answer. Judging for the correct answer to a bet is determined through either the admin team, a chosen third party, or by seeing what the community thinks is the correct answer. The winner of the bet gets to keep the loser's points. A database keeps track of points and win history, and are displayed for other users to see.
